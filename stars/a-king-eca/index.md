Who is King Eca
========

Basically, I'm a philosopher (I want to be one of the greatest philosophers), not a programmer, but I like programming because programming gives me more freedom than anything else. I think modern philosophers should learn programming

My dream is to build a greatest country on earth

Why?

- Because the present human being has lost its way, the future of humanity is dark
- I am the greatest philosopher of all time(Who knows? at least I know:)
