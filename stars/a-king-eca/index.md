Who is King Eca
========

I'm a special scientific philosopher, not a programmer, but I like programming because programming gives me more freedom than anything else. I think modern philosophers should learn to programme

My dream is to [build a greatest country on earth](https://easiestsoft.com/we-create-heaven/)

Why?

- Because the present human being has lost the way, the future of humanity is dark
<!-- - I am the greatest science philosopher ever-->
